### Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International

Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.

#### Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

* <i>Considerations for Licensers:</i> Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensers should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensers should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensers should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. [More considerations for Licensers](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_Licensers_and_licensees#Considerations_for_Licensers).

* <i>Considerations for the public:</i> By using one of our public licenses, a licenser grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licenser’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licenser has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licenser may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.
